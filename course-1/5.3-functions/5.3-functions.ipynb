    "Exercise: writing a function\n",
    "Task\n",
    "In your \"main.py\" notebook, your task is to create a Python function called multiply_by_two() that takes an integer n as input and multiplies it by 2 repeatedly until the result is greater than 50. Your function should then return the final value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hints\n",
    "Use a while loop to repeatedly multiply n by 2 as long as it is less than or equal to 50. A while loop looks like this:  while: <condition>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the *= assignment operator to update the value of n in each iteration. This assignment operator overwrites the existing value of n with the new value. Therefore, you can write n *= 2 which is the same as n = n * 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may need a variable to store the intermediate result (e.g., n2) inside the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the loop condition is no longer met (i.e., when n exceeds 50), return the final value of n \n",
    "\n",
    "Use a print() statement to print out the final result, for example: print(\"If the input is\", n, \"the final value is\", n2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the function by running it with an input value of 10. If your function works correctly, the final input value should be 40 and the final output value should be 80. Your function should work correctly for different initial values of n. Test it with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.\n",
